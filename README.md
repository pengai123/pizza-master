## Welcome to Pizza Master!

This project is a full stack web application, built with React.js, Material-UI, Sass for the frontend, Node.js, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

Deployed at: https://pizza-master.onrender.com/

## Run it locally
Run command `npm install && cd client && npm install` to install dependencies.
And run command `npm run dev` in the `/pizza-master` directory to run it locally.
It should fail to connect to MongoDB because I had `.env` file for environment variables in `.gitignore`.

## Run tests
To be finished..
